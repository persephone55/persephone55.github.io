               I was drawn to this position at DevResults because I admire the way the organization backs up its mission statement to help international nonprofits increase their impact with a cleverly designed, client-centered product that truly is a more effective tool with which these organizations can fight the good fight. As a Peer Trainer at the National Abortion Federation, I prepare new staff for direct service work helping patients navigate emotional crises and overcome logistical barriers to reproductive healthcare. This work has impressed upon me the importance of closely monitoring the needs of those one serves and finding creative solutions to address them; with training, this process has enabled me to generate new training materials that have increased trainee engagement and improved trainee testing results. DevResults’ has applied this process on a much larger scale, enabling the organization to continuously improve an already intuitive and versatile product into a revolutionary one with a dedicated and growing clientele of nonprofits conducting incredible work around the world. These achievements are no surprise when one considers that DevResults has created a product that enables its client organizations to tirelessly strive towards towards without without worrying whether their M&E product will be able to tackle the challenges specific to their work. I would love to have the opportunity to join DevResults’ talented and groundbreaking team in the Indiana Jones of Data Management position.

             My undergraduate research opened my eyes to the power of quantitative research to drive meaningful policy changes and identify solutions to improve health outcomes. This research inspired me to become a Research Assistant at the nonprofit Child Trends, where I helped policymakers, practitioners, and funders who did not have backgrounds in social science identify the most effective options for promoting positive health outcomes in youth by sharing key findings from research with them through accessible written summaries, visual aids, and oral presentations. My subsequent work as a Hotline Intake Counselor at the health advocacy nonprofit the National Abortion Federation allowed me to appreciate the impact of data on a micro level, explaining statistics and technical medical information to address patients’ concerns and enable them to make informed choices about their healthcare.

           I am a fast learner, and the only thing I like more than learning a new skill is being able to share it with others. My work at the National Abortion Federation combined these passions; shortly after training to become a Hotline Intake Counselor, I was promoted to Peer Trainer to lead training for future Hotline Intake Counselors. As Peer Trainer, I also adapt the curriculum and generate new training materials. In this role, I have improved trainee engagement by incorporating a larger variety of learning styles into lesson plans and improved trainee test results on counseling material by creating more effective subject guides.

           As a leader, I go above and beyond the requirements of my role to identify and solve problems, and my collaborative work experience has taught me how to promote harmony and productivity even under stressful circumstances. In my work as Peer Trainer, I recruited staff members to and facilitated a working group to address areas of growth within the organization’s patient and member facility services and to address staff needs. The group has successfully streamlined several processes related to the financial assistance our organization offers and increased the availability of resources requested by staff members. My work as an Hotline Intake Counselor serving patients in crisis or facing substantial logistical barriers to care has taught me that friendly and direct communication, meticulous organization, and attention to detail are the keys to success when working collaboratively.
