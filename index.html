            I was drawn to this position at DevResults because I admire the way the organization backs up its mission statement to help international nonprofits increase their impact with a cleverly designed, client-centered product that truly is a more effective tool with which these organizations can fight the good fight. As a Peer Trainer at the National Abortion Federation, I prepare new staff for direct service work helping patients navigate emotional crises and/or overcome logistical barriers to reproductive healthcare. This work has impressed upon me the importance of closely monitoring the needs of those one serves and finding creative solutions to address them; with training, this process has enabled me to generate new lesson plans and training materials that have increased trainee engagement and improve trainee testing result. DevResults’ has applied this process on a much larger scale, enabling the organization to continuously improve an already intuitive and versatile product into a revolutionary one with a dedicated and growing clientele of nonprofits conducting incredible work around the world. These achievements are no surprise when one considers that DevResults has created a product that enables its client organizations to tirelessly work towards improvement, on the ground wherever they are needed most, without without worrying whether their M&E product will be able to tackle the challenges specific to their work. I would love to have the opportunity to join DevResults’ talented and groundbreaking team as the Indiana Jones of Data Management.

             My love for telling stories with data and its power to drive us towards meaningful policy changes and solutions to improve health outcomes was first sparked by my undergraduate research as a psychology major, and has only grown since. This passion spurred me to become a Research Assistant at the nonprofit Child Trends, where I helped policymakers, practitioners, and funders who did not have a background in social science identify the most effective options for promoting positive health outcomes in youth by sharing key findings from research with them in accessible ways. My work Hotline Intake Counselor at the health advocacy nonprofit the National Abortion Federation allowed me to have a smaller, but more direct impact as I explained statistics and technical medical information to enable patients to make informed choices about their healthcare.

           I am a fast learner, and the only thing I like more than learning a new skill is being able to share it with others. After quickly mastering the art of problem solving and offering crisis counseling to patients as a Hotline Intake Counselor at the healthcare advocacy nonprofit National Abortion Federation (NAF), I became Peer Trainer, where I lead the training I had received when I became a counselor at NAF. As Peer Trainer, I also adapt the training curriculum and generate new training materials to maximize the effectiveness of training. In this role, I have improved trainee engagement by incorporating a larger variety of learning styles into lesson plans and improved trainee test results on counseling material by creating more effective subject guides.

           As a leader, I go above and beyond the requirements of my role to identify and find solutions to problems, and my collaborative work experience has taught me how to promote harmonious productivity even under stressful circumstances. In my work as Peer Trainer, I recruited staff members to and facilitated a working group to address areas of growth within the organization’s patient and member facility services, as well as to address staff needs; the group has successfully streamlined several processes related to the financial assistance our organization offers and increased the availability of resources staff members had requested. My work as an Hotline Intake Counselor serving patients who are in crisis or facing substantial logistical barriers to care has taught me to identify and leverage colleagues’ strengths, and to preempt or address concerns about an plan’s success through friendly and direct communication, meticulous organization, and attention to detail.
